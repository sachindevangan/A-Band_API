# A Band API

## Description
This project is a RESTful API for managing data on music bands and their albums. It provides full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for handling band and album information using MongoDB for data persistence. Built with Node.js and Express, this API is organized modularly for clear separation of database, data manipulation, and routing logic.

## Features
- **Bands**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete information on music bands.
- **Albums**: Manage albums as sub-documents within each band, including album-specific data (title, release date, tracks, and ratings).
- **Validation & Error Handling**: Each endpoint has input validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Efficiently handles database interactions using async/await functions.

- Node.js
- Express.js
